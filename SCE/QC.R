## BASIC QC

# Initially want to look at per cell stats

# Per cell metrics
umi_cell <- perCellQCMetrics(umi,subsets=list(Mito=is_mito))

# Per gene metrics
umi_feature <- perFeatureQCMetrics(umi)

# Adding them all back into the metadata 
umi <- addPerCellQC(umi, subsets=list(Mito=is_mito))
umi <- addPerFeatureQC(umi)
colData(umi)

# ^^ Notice that the 'total' column here is signifying total transcript counts per cell (as rows are cells)
# Viewing counts(umi) or 'molecules' gives the total expression matrix, and this is effectively saying that for one column
# of the expression matrix (which would be one individual cell) the sum of all the counts of that column is 
# the total column. We can confirm that this is true. 

sum(molecules$NA19098.r1.A01) # sum = 63322
colData(umi)[1,14] # = 62669 

# Why is the sum here less? Remember we removed any NA genes, so this likely caused the decrease
# We can also test this by re-running the code and skipping the lines where we did this (line 24-26)
# Sure enough, doing it this way ensures that we got the same number! Hooray. So essentially what we 
# are seeing is 63322 - 62669 = 653 removed genes that were NA for this cell.

# PLOTS

# Since we ultimately want to determine what a significant number of UMI's per 
# cell is, we can do this with some visualization

# This is a histogram of total counts for all cells. 
hist(
  umi$total,
  breaks = 100

# This is a histogram of number of unique umi's per cell
hist(
  umi_cell$detected,
  breaks = 100
)
abline(v = 6244, col = "red")
# This is saying that for most cells there are around 8500 umi's. This is  good, the higher the better


# It is difficult to tell by looking where the threshold should be. We will use adaptive threshold to determine points that 
# are more than 3 median absolute deviations (MADs) away from the median in any of the variables we use for QC.
